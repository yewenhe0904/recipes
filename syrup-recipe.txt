 the breakdown:

 Pour equal parts water and sugar in a saucepan. Remember, the sugar dissolves into the water, so 1 cup of sugar and 1 cup of water will not equal 2 cups of simple syrup. Its more like 1 ½ cups simple syrup once dissolved. Adjust your measurements as needed.

 Heat the ingredients until dissolved. Stir the simple syrup and place the saucepan over medium heat. By the time the edges start to simmer, the liquid should be completely clear, not cloudy. Immediately remove from the heat source.

  
   
   How to Make Simple Syrup on The Pioneer Woman: Food & Friends. (Post from Sommer Collier of A Spicy Perspective)

   Add flavor. If you are making infused simple syrups, this is the time to add the extra ingredients. Stir them into the syrup right as it comes off the burner and cover to allow the simple syrup to steep.

   You can make various flavored batches of simple syrup by pouring the liquid into jars with different ingredients. Cover the jars with the lids while steeping.

   Once the simple syrup is cool, remove the additional ingredients. Leaving mint leaves or citrus rind in the simple syrup long-term will only shorten its shelf life. If youre creating a cocktail bar, you can always garnish the simple syrups later with another cinnamon stick or sprig of rosemary.

   Keep it cold. Store the simple syrup in an airtight container, in the fridge, until ready to use. As mentioned above, basic simple syrup can stay fresh up to 4 weeks, however flavor simple syrups need to be used within a week or two.

   Be creative! This is your chance to play mixologist. Make your favorite classic cocktails fresh and new by adding infused simple syrup variations.

   Consider adding: vanilla beans, cinnamon sticks, cloves, nutmeg, ginger, peppercorns, fresh or dried chiles, various citrus rinds like grapefruit or lime, fresh garden herbs, or even edible flowers like lavender or rose petals.

   Cheers!
